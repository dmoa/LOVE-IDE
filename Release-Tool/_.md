For now, we are using a shell script for exporting LOVE2D games.
This was to make the script as fast as possible, and using a 100% lua library would not be good as it would be very slow.

However, over the course of however long (yeah that's right I'm not setting myself a deadline, and what?),
I will convert to using zlib for zipping files, and using the built in os library for moving and copying files.

I have yet to find a good alternate to cat.
